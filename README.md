# ReciprocalPlayground

## Very early alpha version of a reciprocal space playground to:
 - explore diffraction geometry
 - understand the reciprocal space
 - teach single crystal X-ray diffraction

## Version 0.0.2 (17.10.2025)
 - Calculation of symmetry equivalent reflections (and completeness) unified and fixed.
 - Detector parameters adjustable via GUI.
 - Hotkeys! Use F1-F2-F3 to look down the cell axes a-b-c, F4-F5-F6 to look down on Omega, Chi and Phi.

## How it looks

>[!WARNING]
>This comes with plenty of bugs!

I hope you like it anyway.
